# Lollercoaster Tycoon

The Lollercoaster Tycoon project aims to extend the lollercoaster meme started
in 2004 by creating a procedurally generated track that never ends. Run the
run.py script in the root directory to start the whimsical journey today.

## Requirements

- colorama

## Future Improvements

- Add more graphics such as stations, loops, and underground passages.
- Add physics so that instead of a constant framerate, the frames cycle based on
  lollercoaster speed.
- Allow the lollercoaster to go above the max height by creating a windowed view
  of where it currently is.
